Okey, firstly you might want to know what the Yasnogorsk is...and it will be absolutely relevant question. Yasnogorsk is a small town which is located nearly Tula Region (Russia). Population of this these tiny territories estimates approximately 20000 people. There is no much media sources like the biggest cities have - only couple of local newspapers that can not provide latest information. However local citizens always know where they can get valid information about what is going in town. That place called [**Typical Yasnogorsk** ](https://vk.com/typical_yasnogorsk)

This is public community in VK [^one of the biggest Russian Social Networks]. People who live their town can get freshest information about everything that happened in their town. The main purpose of this superficial analysis was to demonstrate how  different and interesting followers of this community are. 

Data for exploration has been taken by VK API (using **Implicit Flow** Token for authorization). Subsets for observed categories have been selected based on the presence of corresponding value for certain categories [^size of data can be different for all distributions].

## 1. Followers Distribution By Sex and Age

The first two categories that have been examined are age and sex. All followers who mentioned year of birth and sex in their public profile at VK have been selected for examination. The result are as follows: sex distribution demonstrated that we have almost equal number of man and women in community (female followers has a slight advantage). Age distribution illustrated that **median of followers is 36 years old** and only 25% of followers are older than 47 years. The youngest follower is 14 years old, while the oldest user is 122 years old which is probably a joke (Picture 1)

## 2. Followers Distribution By Current City

Next category followers were examined by is distribution according to their current place for a living. Spread in values was significant that was the primary reason why only first ten cities were presented on bar chart. It is obvious that the main part of community followers lives in [Yasnogorsk](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA_(%D0%A2%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C)) (Picture 2). Other cities with silver and bronze medals in this distribution are Tula and Moscow which can lead us to conclusion that the majority of followers don't like moving far from Yasnogorsk and prefer to live nearly.

## 3. Followers Distribution By Relation

With regards to followers relation status, significant part of examined users prefers not to say about their relationship (or just does not know hot to work with profile statutes). Subsequently, the widest bar on the diagram is "unknown". However, there are also a lot of followers who preferred to expose their relationship status (and even mentioned their partner). Results of this distribution are demonstrated below (Picture 3)

## 4. Followers Distribution By Bad Habits
Next it would be great to see how healthy community followers are. In order to achieve this there was examination of followers in terms of their bad habits like smoking and drinking alcohol beverages. Distributions were based on followers who mentioned their attitude to smoking and alcohol in own profile. Both charts demonstrated that mostly people are absolutely neutral to these harmful habits.
